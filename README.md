Project outlining the improvements on image compression in a specific domain (in this case: satellite imagery). This folder contains analysis/research, code and results/images of a Auto Encoder model with a hyperprior based on a Student-t distribution, 
which yields lower bpp compression results than state-of-the-art general compression models, specifically satellite image patches.
